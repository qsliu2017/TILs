# TILs

> Today I Learned

Inspired by [Simon Willison's *One year of TILs*](https://simonwillison.net/2021/May/2/one-year-of-tils/) and [Josh Branchaud’s collection](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) (recursively).

> They also reflect my values as a software engineer. The thing I love most about this career is that the opportunities to learn new things never reduce—there will always be new sub-disciplines to explore, and I aspire to learn something new every single working day.
